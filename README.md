# Tracking-ships-using-1-D-sonar-sensor-data
Tracking position of ships using simulated passive sonar scenario based on one-dimensional measurement data consisting of frequnency and bearing.
Artificial Neural networks are used for prediction of position of targets.

# Softwares
- Python 3.6
- Pandas for loading, preprocessing and analysis
- scikit-learn for Machine Learning and deep learniing models
