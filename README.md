# Tracking-ships-using-1-D-sonar-sensor-data
Tracking position of ships using simulated passive sonar scenario based on one-dimensional measurement data consisting of either frequnency or bearing.
Artificial Neural networks will be used for prediction of position of targets, Machine Learning models like random forests will be used for removing noise i.e. detecting wrong recordings. 
Self Organizing maps will be implemented and tested.
